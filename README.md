- 👋 Hi, I’m Dogg1
- 👀 I’m interested in Cities Skylines and simple programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve my Python powered Discord bot
- 💞️ I’m hopefully going to make a mod for Cities Skylines... soon... But I mainly write Python, know a bit of C++ and CS uses C#
- 📫 I can be best reached from Discord. My DMs are open and my Discord ID is `431379479181656064`
